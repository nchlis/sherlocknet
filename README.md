## Sherlocknet

A character to character LSTM model for text generation.
The network was trained on the sherlock holmes books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

## Dataset

The following books were used:
- a study in scarlet
- the sign of the four
- the hound of the baskervilles
- the valley of fear
- the adventure of sherlock holmes
- the memoirs of sherlock holmes
- the return of sherlock holmes
- his last bow

all available on Project Gutenberg https://www.gutenberg.org/
the header and footer of each book was removed prior to training and
all books were concatenated in a single .txt file.

## Code & More information
Sherlocknet was based on the keras example code at:

## Example generated text 
800 characters generated with different values of diversity.
Low diversity values yield technically correct but repetitive and boring results.
Higher values of diversity are more "adventurous".
